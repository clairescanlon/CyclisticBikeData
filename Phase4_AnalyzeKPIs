###### PHASE 4 - ANALYZE DATA ######

### KPI for average ride duration per user type (based on weighted average to reduce bias as the sizes of the two groups are not the same)

# Load member_data and casual_data
load("member_data.Rda")
load("casual_data.Rda")

# Calculate the total ride duration and number of rides for each user type
member_summary <- member_data %>%
  summarise(total_ride_duration = sum(ride_duration),
            total_rides = n())

casual_summary <- casual_data %>%
  summarise(total_ride_duration = sum(ride_duration),
            total_rides = n())

# Calculate weights based on the number of rides
member_weight <- member_summary$total_rides / (member_summary$total_rides + casual_summary$total_rides)
casual_weight <- casual_summary$total_rides / (member_summary$total_rides + casual_summary$total_rides)

# Calculate the weighted average ride duration for each user type
weighted_average_duration <- (member_summary$total_ride_duration * member_weight +
                                casual_summary$total_ride_duration * casual_weight) /
  (member_weight + casual_weight)

# Print the results
cat("Weighted Average Ride Duration (Member):", weighted_average_duration[1], "minutes\n")
cat("Weighted Average Ride Duration (Casual):", weighted_average_duration[1], "minutes\n")

# Create a data frame with weighted average ride duration for each customer group
weighted_average_df <- data.frame(Customer_Group = c("Member", "Casual"),
                                  Weighted_Average_Ride_Duration = weighted_average_duration)
