***The capstone is based on the six phases of the Google Data Analysis Process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.***

Phase 1: Ask
Define the problem you want to solve or the question you want to answer with your analysis.
Identify the data you need to answer the question or solve the problem.
Determine the scope of the analysis.
Define key metrics and performance indicators.
Identify potential biases and limitations of the data and analysis.

Phase 2: Prepare
Collect and acquire the necessary data from your sources.
Clean and transform the data to ensure that it is accurate and consistent.
Organize and structure your data in a way that is easy to analyze.
Merge and aggregate the data as needed.
Identify and handle any missing or null values.
Check for any outliers or anomalies in the data.
Create a data dictionary to document the variables and their definitions.
Determine the variables of interest for the analysis.
Split the data into training and test sets as needed for predictive modeling.
Normalize or standardize the data as needed.
Save the cleaned data to a separate file for future use.

Phase 3: Process
Explore the data using summary statistics and visualizations.
Identify any correlations or patterns in the data.
Perform feature engineering to create new variables or transform existing ones.
Select relevant variables for analysis and remove irrelevant ones.
Use statistical methods to identify significant variables or relationships.
Use machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
Fine-tune model parameters as needed.
Apply the final model to the test set for evaluation.
Save the final model for future use.

Phase 4: Analyze
Interpret the results of the analysis.
Identify key findings and insights.
Use visualizations to communicate the findings and insights.
Perform hypothesis testing to validate findings and insights.
Perform sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the findings and insights.
Identify any limitations or potential biases in the analysis and findings.
Summarize the findings and insights in a report or presentation.
Provide recommendations based on the findings and insights.
Collaborate with stakeholders to ensure the analysis meets their needs.
Prepare for any questions or concerns stakeholders may have about the analysis.

Phase 5: Share
Determine the best way to share the findings and insights with stakeholders.
Tailor the report or presentation to the intended audience and ensure it is easily understandable.
Include visualizations and key metrics to support the findings and insights.
Use appropriate language and tone to communicate the results.
Address any potential concerns or objections that stakeholders may have.
Provide access to the data and analysis code as needed.
Solicit feedback from stakeholders and incorporate it as appropriate.
Archive the analysis and findings for future reference.

Phase 6: Act
Use the insights and recommendations from the analysis to inform decision-making.
Develop an action plan based on the recommendations.
Assign responsibilities and establish timelines for implementing the action plan.
Monitor and track progress towards implementing the action plan.
Evaluate the effectiveness of the action plan.
Track and measure key performance indicators to monitor progress towards achieving goals.
Adjust the action plan as needed based on new data or feedback.
Communicate progress and results to stakeholders.
Celebrate successes and learn from failures.
Archive the final report and analysis for future reference.
